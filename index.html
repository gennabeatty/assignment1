						<p>It’s just a moment in time – just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another outstretched hand. But it’s a connection.</p>
                        <p>We make sure everything we do honors that connection – from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.</p>
<p>From our beginnings as a single store over forty years ago, in every place that we’ve been, and every place that we touch, we've tried to make it a little better than we found it.</p>

									</header>
									
                                    <p>From the beginning, Starbucks set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee and the rich tradition, but that also brought a feeling of connection. Our mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.</p>

									<h3>Delicious, handcrafted beverages and great-tasting food. The secret to making life better.</h3>
								    
                                    <hr>

                                    <p>It’s true. The perfect cup of coffee and a wholesome, delicious snack can make your day. So we make sure everything you choose is of the finest quality. Because really, isn’t that how life should be?</p>
                              
                                <p>Today, with more than 15,000 stores in 50 countries, Starbucks is the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world. And with every cup, we strive to bring both our heritage and an exceptional experience to life.</p>
                                    
                                <p>When our customers feel this sense of belonging, our stores become a haven, a break from the worries outside, a place where you can meet with friends. It’s about enjoyment at the speed of life – sometimes slow and savored, sometimes faster. Always full of humanity.</p>
